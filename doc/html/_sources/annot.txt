Quote from the Adobe manual: "An annotation associates an object such as a note, sound, or movie with a location on a page of a PDF document, or provides a way to interact with the user by means of the mouse and keyboard."

This class supports accessing such annotations - not only for PDF files, but for all MuPDF supported document types. However, a minority of properties applies to non-PDF documents.

**Class API**

.. class:: Annot

   .. method:: getPixmap(matrix = fitz.Ientity, colorspace = fitz.csRGB)

      Creates a pixmap from the annotation as it appears on the page in untransformed coordinates. The pixmap's :ref:`IRect` is equal to ``Annot.rect.round()`` (see below).

      :param `matrix`: a matrix to be used for image creation. Default value is the ``fitz.Identity`` matrix.
      :type `matrix`: :ref:`Matrix`

      :param `cspace`: a colorspace to be used for image creation. Default value is ``fitz.csRGB``.
      :type `cspace`: :ref:`Colorspace`

      :rtype: :ref:`Pixmap`

   .. attribute:: rect

      The rectangle containing the annotation in untransformed coordinates.

      :rtype: :ref:`Rect`

   .. attribute:: next

      The next annotation on this page or ``None``.

      :rtype: ``Annot``

   .. attribute:: type

      Meaningful for PDF only: A number and a string describing the annotation type, e.g. ``[12, 'Stamp']``. If not PDF, it will contain ``[]``. See the appendix :ref:`Annotation Types` for a list of possible values and their meanings.

      :rtype: list

   .. attribute:: content

      Meaningful for PDF only: A string containing the text for type ``Text`` and ``FreeText`` annotations. For other types the entry is optional. Contains an empty string if not specified or not a PDF.

      :rtype: str

   .. attribute:: name

      Meaningful for PDF only: A string containing the name of the annotation. Contains an empty string if not specified or not a PDF. For e.g. ``[12, 'Stamp']`` type annotations it will contain the stamp text like ``Sold`` or ``Experimental``.

      :rtype: str

   .. attribute:: title

      Meaningful for PDF only: A string containing the title of the annotation's pop-up window. By convention, this is normally used for the name of the user who entered the annotation.

      :rtype: str

   .. attribute:: date

      Meaningful for PDF only: A string containing the PDF timestamp of the annotation's last modification.

      :rtype: str

   .. attribute:: flags

      Meaningful for PDF only: An integer with its low order byte containing flags for how the annotation should be presented. See section :ref:`Annotation Flags` for details.

      :rtype: int

   .. attribute:: lineEnds

      Meaningful for PDF only: A list specifying the starting and the ending appearance of annotations of types ``Line``, ``PolyLine``, etc. An example would be ``['None', 'OpenArrow']``. If not specified or not applicable, it contains an empty list ``[]``. For possible values and descriptions in this list, see the Adobe manual, table 8.27 on page 630.

      :rtype: list

   .. attribute:: vertices

      Meaningful for PDF only: A list of float coordinates for annotations of type ``PolyLine`` and ``Polygon``. Every pair of floats specifies a point ("vertex") of the annotation graph. Contains an empty list ``[]`` when not applicable.

      :rtype: list

   .. attribute:: inkList

      Meaningful for PDF only: ... work in progress ...

      :rtype: list
