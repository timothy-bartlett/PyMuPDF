The different format handlers (pdf, xps etc) interpret pages to a device. These devices can then process the stream of calls they recieve in various ways:

* The bbox device calculates the bounding box for the page.
* The draw device will render them.
* The list device stores them in a list to play back later.
* The text device performs text extraction and searching.

Device can be created by :

* :meth:`Pixmap.new_draw_device`
* :meth:`DisplayList.new_list_device`
* :meth:`TextPage.new_text_device`
