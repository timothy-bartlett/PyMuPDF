Changes in Version 1.9.1
=========================
This version of PyMuPDF is based on MuPDF library source code version 1.9a published on April 21, 2016.

Please have a look at MuPDF's website to see which changes and enhancements are contained herein.

Changes in these bindings compared to version 1.8.0 are the following:

* New methods ``getRectArea()`` for both ``fitz.Rect`` and ``fitz.IRect``
* Pixmaps can now be created directly from files using the new constructor ``fitz.Pixmap(filename)``. All of the following image formats covered by MuPDF are thus also supported as inputs for pixmaps: BMP, JPEG, JXR, PNG, GIF, TIFF.
* The Pixmap constructor ``fitz.Pixmap(data, len(data))`` has been extended accordingly to support the above image formats as well (not just PNG as it did in version 1.8.0).
* ``fitz.Rect`` objects can now be created with all possible combinations of points and coordinates.
* PyMuPDF classes and methods now all contain  __doc__ strings,  most of them created by SWIG automatically. While the PyMuPDF documentation certainly is more detailed, this feature should help a lot when programming in Python-aware IDEs.
* A new method of ``fitz.Document.getPermits()`` returns the permissions associated with the current access to the document (print, edit, annotate, copy), as a Python dictionary.
* The identity matrix ``fitz.Identity`` is now **immutable**.
* The new method ``fitz.Document.select(list)`` removes all pages from an open document that are not contained in the list. Pages can also be duplicated and re-arranged.
* Various improvements and new members in our demo and examples collections. Perhaps most prominently: ``PDF_display`` now supports scrolling with the mouse wheel, and there is a new example program ``wxTableExtract`` which allows to graphically identify and extract table data in documents.
* ``fitz.open()`` is an alias of ``fitz.Document()``.
* New method ``fitz.Pixmap.getPNGData()`` which will return a memory area formatted as a PNG image of the pixmap.
* New technical method ``fitz.Pixmap.samplesRGB()`` providing a ``samples`` version with alpha bytes stripped off (RGB colorspaces only).
* New technical method ``fitz.Pixmap.samplesAlpha()`` providing the alpha bytes only of the ``samples`` area.
* New iterator over a document's set of pages.
* New matrix methods ``invert()`` (calculate inverted matrix), ``concat()`` (calculate matrix product), ``preTranslate()`` (perform a shift operation).
* New ``IRect`` methods ``intersect()`` (intersection with another rectangle), ``translate()`` (perform a shift operation).
* New ``Rect`` methods ``intersect()`` (intersection with another rectangle), ``transform()`` (transformation with a matrix), ``includePoint()`` (enlarge rectangle to also contain a point), ``includeRect()`` (enlarge rectangle to also contain another one).
* Documented ``Point.transform()`` (transform a point with a matrix).
