Introduction
=============
**PyMuPDF** (formerly known as python-fitz) is a Python binding for `MuPDF <http://www.mupdf.com/>`_ - "a lightweight PDF and XPS viewer".

MuPDF can access files in PDF, XPS, OpenXPS, CBZ (comic book) and EPUB (e-book) formats.

These are files with extensions ``*.pdf``, ``*.xps``, ``*.oxps``, ``*.cbz`` or ``*.epub`` (so in essence, with this binding you can develop **e-book viewers in Python** ...)

PyMuPDF provides access to all important functions of MuPDF from within a Python environment. Nevertheless, this function set is continuously being increased.

MuPDF stands out among all similar products for its top rendering capability and unsurpassed processing speed.

You can check this out yourself:
Compare the various free PDF-viewers. In terms of speed and rendering quality `SumatraPDF <http://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/>`_ ranges at the top (apart from MuPDF's own viewer) - and it is based on  MuPDF!

While PyMuPDF has been available since several years for an earlier version of MuPDF (1.2), it was until only recently (mid May 2015), that its creator and a few co-workers decided to elevate it to the current release 1.7a of MuPDF.

And we are determined to keep PyMuPDF current with future MuPDF changes!

This work is now completed.

PyMuPDF has been tested and can be used today on Linux, Windows 7 and up, Python 2 and Python 3 (x86 versions).

**So, what do we have?**

* We have ready and working installation procedures for Linux and Windows.

* We have example and demo scripts for typical use cases that you can take as templates for your development.

* We have greatly simplified the installation procedure for Windows and Linux platforms.


We invite you to join our efforts by contributing to the the wiki pages, by testing what is there - and, of course, by submitting issues and bugs to the site!
