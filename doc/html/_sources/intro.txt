Introduction
=============
**PyMuPDF** (formerly known as python-fitz) is a Python binding for `MuPDF <http://www.mupdf.com/>`_ - "a lightweight PDF and XPS viewer".

MuPDF can access files in PDF, XPS, OpenXPS, CBZ (comic book) and EPUB (e-book) formats.

These are files with extensions ``*.pdf``, ``*.xps``, ``*.oxps``, ``*.cbz`` or ``*.epub`` (so in essence, with this binding you can develop **e-book viewers in Python** ...)

PyMuPDF provides access to all important functions of MuPDF from within a Python environment. Nevertheless, we are continuously expanding this function set.

MuPDF stands out among all similar products for its top rendering capability and unsurpassed processing speed.

You can check this out yourself:
Compare the various free PDF-viewers. In terms of speed and rendering quality `SumatraPDF <http://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/>`_ ranges at the top (apart from MuPDF's own standalone viewer) - and it is based on  MuPDF!

While PyMuPDF has been available since several years for an earlier version of MuPDF (1.2), it was until only mid May 2015, that its creator and a few co-workers decided to elevate it to support the current release of MuPDF (1.7a).

And we are determined to keep PyMuPDF current with future MuPDF changes!

This work is now completed.

PyMuPDF has been tested on Linux, Windows 7 and up, Python 2 and Python 3 (x86 versions). Other platforms should work too as long as MuPDF supports them.

The main differences compared to version 1.2 are

* A greatly simplified installation procedure: For Windows and Linux platforms it should come down to running the ``python setup.py install`` command.

* The API has changed: it is now simpler and a lot less cryptic.

* The supported function set has been significantly increased: apart from rendering, MuPDF's traditional strength, we now also offer a wide range of text extraction options.

* Demo code has been extended, and an additional ``examples`` directory is there to contain working programs. Among them are an editor for a document's table of contents, a full featured document joiner and a document-to-text conversion utility.

We invite you to join our efforts by contributing to the the wiki pages, by using what is there - and, of course, by submitting issues and bugs to the site!

Note on the Name ``fitz``
--------------------------
The Python import statement for this library is ``import fitz``. Here is the reason why:

The original rendering library for MuPDF was called ``Libart``. "After Artifex Software acquired the MuPDF project, the development focus shifted on writing a new modern graphics library called ``Fitz``. Fitz was originally intended as an R&D project to replace the aging Ghostscript graphics library, but has instead become the rendering engine powering MuPDF." (Quoted from `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MuPDF>`_).
