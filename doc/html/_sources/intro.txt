Introduction
=============
**PyMuPDF** (formerly known as python-fitz) is a Python binding for `MuPDF <http://www.mupdf.com/>`_ - "a lightweight PDF and XPS viewer".

MuPDF can access files in PDF, XPS, OpenXPS, CBZ (comic book) and EPUB (e-book) formats.

These are files with extensions ``*.pdf``, ``*.xps``, ``*.oxps``, ``*.cbz`` or ``*.epub`` (so in essence, with this binding you can develop **e-book viewers in Python** ...)

PyMuPDF provides access to all important functions of MuPDF from within a Python environment. Nevertheless, we will always consider expanding this function set.

MuPDF stands out among all similar products for its top rendering capability and unsurpassed processing speed.

You can check this out yourself:
Compare the various free PDF-viewers. In terms of speed and rendering quality `SumatraPDF <http://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/>`_ ranges at the top (apart from MuPDF's own standalone viewer) - and it is based on  MuPDF!

While PyMuPDF has been available since several years for an earlier version of MuPDF (1.2), it was until only mid May 2015, that its creator and a few co-workers decided to elevate it to support the current release of MuPDF (1.7a).

And we are determined to keep PyMuPDF current with future MuPDF changes!

This work is now completed.

PyMuPDF has been tested on Linux, Windows 7 and up, Python 2 and Python 3 (x86 versions). Other OS platforms should work too as long as MuPDF supports them.

**So, what do we have?**

* We have ready and working installation procedures for Linux and Windows.

* We have example and demo scripts for typical use cases that you can take as templates for your development.

* Compared to version 1.2, we have greatly simplified the installation procedure for Windows and Linux platforms.
