.. _Link:

================
**Link**
================
Represents a link to somewhere (in the document, other documents or the internet). Links are by document page, and they are chained to each other, starting from an initial link which is accessible by the ``page.loadLinks()`` method.

Methods
=======

============================= =================================================================================
:meth:`~Link.rect`            Get the hot zone. The area that can be clicked in untransformed coordinates.
:meth:`~Link.get_kind`        Get the kind of link destination.
:meth:`~Link.get_uri`         Get a UTF-8 encoded URI to launch.
:meth:`~Link.get_page`        Get the target page number of a internal link
:meth:`~Link.get_page_flags`  Get the validity and meaning of a internal link, see :data:`fz_link_flag`
:meth:`~Link.get_page_lt`     Get the top left corner of the destination bounding box.
:meth:`~Link.get_page_rb`     Get the bottom right corner of the destination bounding box.

Class API

.. class:: Link

   .. method:: rect(self)

      Get the hot zone. The area that can be clicked in untransformed coordinates.

      :rtype: :ref:`Rect`

   .. method:: get_kind(self)

      Get the kind of link destination.

      :rtype: :data:`fz_link_kind`

   .. method:: get_uri(self)

      Get a UTF-8 encoded URI to launch. Return ``None`` if no uri avaliable.

      :rtype: string

   .. method:: get_page(self)

      Get the target page number of a internal link

      :rtype: int

   .. method:: get_page_flags(self)

      Get the validity and meaning of a internal link, see :data:`fz_link_flag`.

	  The flags is a bitfield consisting of :data:`fz_link_flag` describing the validity and meaning of the different parts of lr and rb. Link destinations are constructed (as far as possible) so that lt and rb can be treated as a bounding box, though the validity flags indicate which of the values was actually specified in the file.

      .. seealso:: :meth:`~Link.get_page_lt`, :meth:`~Link.get_page_rb`

      :rtype: int

   .. method:: get_page_lt(self)

      Get the top left corner of the destination bounding box.

      .. warning:: For the returning point, (0, 0) is in the bottom left corner, which is different from :ref:`Rect` and :ref:`BBox`.

      :rtype: :ref:`Point`

   .. method:: get_page_rb(self)

      Get the bottom right corner of the destination bounding box.

      .. warning:: For the returning point, (0, 0) is in the bottom left corner, which is different from :ref:`Rect` and :ref:`BBox`.

      :rtype: :ref:`Point`
