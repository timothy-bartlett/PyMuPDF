Installation
=============
This describes how to install PyMuPDF. For most platforms, this encompasses downloading and generating MuPDF, and then downloading and generating PyMuPDF.

If your operating system ist Windows 7 or higher (x86 or x64), you have two options.
  * Option 1 is the same as for other plaforms, detailed out in the following steps 1 through 3.
  * Option 2 means performing one of the binary setups. This process is **a lot faster** and requires no compiler, no Visual Studio, no download of MuPDF, no download of PyMuPDF. You only need to download PyMuPDF-optional-material.

Option 1, Step 1: Download PyMuPDF
-----------------------------------
Download this repository and unzip / decompress it. This will give you a folder, let us call it ``PyFitz``.

Option 1, Step 2: Download and Generate MuPDF 1.8
--------------------------------------------------
Download ``mupdf-1.8-source.tar.gz`` from `MuPDF version 1.8 source <http://mupdf.com/downloads/>`_, now and unzip / decompress it. Let us call the resulting folder ``mupdf``.

Put it inside ``PyFitz`` as a subdirectory for keeping everything in one place.

**Generate MuPDF now**. The MuPDF source includes generation procedures / makefiles for numerous platforms. For Windows platforms, Visual Studio solution and project definitions are provided.

Option 1, Step 3: Build / Setup PyMuPDF
----------------------------------------
Adjust the setup.py script as necessary. E.g. make sure that

  * the include directory is correctly set in sync with your directory structure
  * the object code libraries are correctly defined

Now perform a ``python setup.py install``

Option 1, Note on using UPX
----------------------------
In Windows systems, your PyMuPDF installation will end up with four files: ``__init__.py``, ``fitz.py``, ``utils.py`` and ``_fitz.pyd`` in the ``site-packages`` directory (PYD files are Python's DLL version on Windows systems). ``_fitz.pyd`` has a size of 9.5 to 10 MB.

You can reduce this by applying the compression utility UPX to it: ``upx -9 _fitz.pyd``. This will reduce the file size to about 4.5 MB. This should reduce load times (``import fitz`` statement) while keeping it fully functional.

Option 2, Step 1: Download Optional Material
---------------------------------------------
Download `PyMuPDF-optional-material <https://github.com/JorjMcKie/PyMuPDF-optional-material/>`_. From directory ``binary_setups`` select the zip file corresponding to your configuration and unzip it anywhere you like.

Option 2, Step 2: Install PyMuPDF
----------------------------------
Open a command prompt at the unzipped folder's top level and enter ``python setup.py install``.

Done.

This process requires no compiler or Visual Studio and is **very** fast (just a couple of seconds). The only pre-requisite is, that your Python configuration matches the zip file as follows:

``setup_XY_platform.zip`` is for you if you have installed Python X.Y for ``platform``. If you are not sure, open a command prompt and start the Python interpreter and you will see something like this:
::
 Python 2.7.9 (default, Dec 10 2014, 12:24:55) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
 Type "copyright", "credits" or "license()" for more information.
 >>>

In this example case choose ``setup_27_win32.zip`` to install PyMuPDF.
