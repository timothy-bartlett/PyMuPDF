=============
Installation
=============
This describes how to install python-fitz.

Step 1: Download python-fitz
=============================
Download this repository and unzip it. This will give you a folder, let us call it ``PyFitz``.

Step 2: Download MuPDF 1.7a
============================
Download `MuPDF version 1.7a source <http://mupdf.com/downloads/>`_, and unzip it. Let us call the resulting folder ``mupdf17``.

Put it inside ``PyFitz`` as a subdirectory, if you want to keep everything in one place.

Step 3: Build / Setup python-fitz
===================================
If necessary, adjust the setup.py script now. E.g. make sure that

  * the include directory is correctly set in sync with your directory structure

It is no longer necessary to generate MuPDF object code if your platform is either Windows (32 Bit) or Linux.
The required object libraries for these two platforms have been put into respective directories, and the setup script has been updated. These are the names of those directories:

	* LibLinux - for the Linux-generated MuPDF libraries
	* LibWin32 - for the Windows-generated MuPDF libraries

Now perform a ``python setup.py install``
