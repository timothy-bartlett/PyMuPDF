Installation
=============
Installation generally encompasses downloading and generating PyMuPDF and MuPDF from sources.

This process consists of three steps described below under **"Option 1: Install from Sources"**.

If your operating system is Windows 7 or higher (x86 or x64), you can perform a binary setup, detailed out under **"Option 2: Install from Binaries"**. This process is **a lot faster** and requires no compiler, no Visual Studio, no download of MuPDF, even no download of PyMuPDF. You only need to download those binaries from PyMuPDF-optional-material or PyPI, that fit your Python version.

Option 1: Install from Sources
-------------------------------

Step 1: Download PyMuPDF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Download this repository and unzip / decompress it. This will give you a folder, let us call it ``PyFitz``.

Step 2: Download and Generate MuPDF 1.9
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Download ``mupdf-1.9a-source.tar.gz`` from `MuPDF version 1.9a source <http://mupdf.com/downloads/>`_, now and unzip / decompress it. Call the resulting folder ``mupdf``.

Make sure you download the (sub-) version for which PyMuPDF has stated its compatibility. The various Linux flavors usually have their own specific ways to support download of packages which we cannot cover here. Do not hesitate posting inquiries to our web site or sending e-mail to the authors for getting support.

Put it inside ``PyFitz`` as a subdirectory for keeping everything in one place.

**Controlling the Binary File Size:**

Since version 1.9, MuPDF includes support for many dozens of additional fonts for all sorts of alphabets from all over the world like Chinese, Japanese, Corean, Kyrillic, Indonesian, etc. If you accept the MuPDF standard here, the resulting binary for PyMuPDF will be quite big and easily approach 20 MB.

If you feel you do not want or need every font, you can reduce their amount by adding appropriate ``#define`` statements to header file ``/include/mupdf/fitz.h`` by inserting ``#define`` statements like this:
::
 #ifndef MUDPF_FITZ_H
 #define MUDPF_FITZ_H

 #define NOTO_SMALL          // choose a small set of extra fonts
 #define TOFU_CJK            // exclude Android specific fonts

 #ifdef __cplusplus
 extern "C" {
 #endif
 ...

The above minimal choice should bring down the binary file size to a one digit MB amount.

Check out file ``.../source/fitz/noto.c`` to see other possible combinations.

**Generate MuPDF now**.

The MuPDF source includes generation procedures / makefiles for numerous platforms. For Windows platforms, Visual Studio solution and project definitions are provided.

Consult additional installation hints on PyMuPDF's `main page <https://github.com/rk700/PyMuPDF/>`_ on Github.com.

Step 3: Build / Setup PyMuPDF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Adjust the setup.py script as necessary. E.g. make sure that
  * the include directory is correctly set in sync with your directory structure
  * the object code libraries are correctly defined

Now perform a ``python setup.py install``.

Using UPX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Your PyMuPDF installation will end up with four files: ``__init__.py``, ``fitz.py``, ``utils.py`` and the binary ``_fitz.xxx`` in the ``site-packages`` directory. The extension of the binary will be ``.pyd`` on Windows and ``.so`` on Linux.

Depending on your OS, your compiler and your font support choice (see above), this binary can be quite large: ranging from 8 MB to 20 MB. You can reduce this by applying the compression utility `UPX <http://upx.sourceforge.net/>`_ to it, which exists for many operating systems. UPX will reduce the size of ``_fitz.xxx`` by more than 50%. You will end up with 4 MB to 9 MB without impacting functionality or execution speed.

Option 2: Install from Binaries
--------------------------------
Step 1: Download Optional Material
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Download `PyMuPDF-optional-material <https://github.com/JorjMcKie/PyMuPDF-optional-material/>`_. From directory ``binary_setups`` select the zip file corresponding to your configuration and unzip it anywhere you like. To reduce download time, just download the zip file corresponding to your Python version, or get it from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyMuPDF/1.9.1>`_.

Step 2: Install PyMuPDF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Open a command prompt at the unzipped folder's top level and enter ``python setup.py install``.

**You are done after 2 seconds.**

This process requires no compiler or Visual Studio and is **very** fast. The only pre-requisite is, that your Python configuration matches the zip file.

Targeting Parallel Python Installations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Setup scripts for binary install support the Python launcher ``py.exe`` introduced with version 3.3.

They contain **shebang lines** specifying the intended Python version, and additional checks for detecting error situations.

This can be used to target the right Python version if you have several installed in parallel (and of course the Python launcher, too). Use the following statement to set up PyMuPDF correctly:

``py setup.py install``

The shebang line of ``setup.py`` will be interpreted by ``py.exe`` to automatically find the right Python, and the internal checks will make sure that version and bitness are as they sould be.
