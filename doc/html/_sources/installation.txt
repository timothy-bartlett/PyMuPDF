=============
Installation
=============
This describes how to install python-fitz.

Step 1: Download python-fitz
============================
Download this repository and unzip it. This will give you a folder, let us call it ``PyFitz``.

Step 2: Download MuPDF 1.7a
===========================
Download MuPDF version 1.7(a) source, and unzip it. Let us call the resulting folder ``mupdf17``.

You can put it inside ``PyFitz`` as a subdirectory, if you want keep everything in one place.

Step 3: Generate MuPDF
========================
For many platforms supported by MuPDF, generating scripts are provided. I.e. makefiles exist for Linux / Unix platforms and Visual Studio solutions / projects are provided for Windows. As MuPDF depends on a number of third party software components, you must generate these, too. Follow the instructions provided with the MuPDF download package.


For Windows, you only need to BUILD the solution in Visual Studio (set the configuration to "Release Win32"). This will generate MuPDF together with any third party software.


The result of this step will be libraries, which are needed for the setup of python-fitz.


On Windows, the following two libraries are required: ``libmupdf.lib`` and ``libthirdparty.lib``.


On Unix / Linux platforms, the libraries are these: ``mupdf.a``, ``mujs.a``, ``crypto.a``, ``jbig2dec.a``, ``openjp2.a``, ``jpeg.a`` and ``freetype.a``.

Step 4: Build / Setup python-fitz
===================================
If necessary, adjust the setup.py script now. E.g. make sure that

  * the include directory is correctly set,
  * the directory for the libraries created in Step 3 is correcly set.

Now perform a ``python setup.py install``
