Installation
=============
This describes how to install PyMuPDF.

Step 1: Download PyMuPDF
-------------------------------
Download this repository and unzip it. This will give you a folder, let us call it ``PyFitz``.

Step 2: Download MuPDF 1.7a
---------------------------------
Download `MuPDF version 1.7a source <http://mupdf.com/downloads/>`_, and unzip it. Let us call the resulting folder ``mupdf17``.

Put it inside ``PyFitz`` as a subdirectory, if you want to keep everything in one place.

If your platform is **not Linux and not Windows**, you must **generate MuPDF now**. The download includes generation procedures / makefiles for numerous platforms.

On Linux and on Windows, this is not necessary: MuPDF object code is pregenerated and put in special directories:
	* LibLinux - for the Linux-generated MuPDF libraries
	* LibWin32 - for the Windows-generated MuPDF libraries

Step 3: Build / Setup PyMuPDF
----------------------------------
If necessary, adjust the setup.py script now. E.g. make sure that

  * the include directory is correctly set in sync with your directory structure
  * the object code libraries are correctly defined

Now perform a ``python setup.py install``

Note on using UPX
------------------
In Windows systems, your PyMuPDF installation will end up with three files: ``__init__.py``, ``fitz.py`` and ``_fitz.pyd`` in the ``site-packages`` directory. The PYD file is Python's DLL version on Windows systems. ``_fitz.pyd`` has a size of 9.5 to 10 MB.

You can reduce this by applying the compression utility UPX to it: ``upx -9 _fitz.pyd``. This will reduce the file to about 4.5 MB. This should reduce load times (``import fitz`` statement) while keeping it fully functional.
