Installation
=============
This describes how to install PyMuPDF.

Step 1: Download PyMuPDF
-------------------------------
Download this repository and unzip / decompress it. This will give you a folder, let us call it ``PyFitz``.

Step 2: Download MuPDF 1.8
----------------------------
Download ``mupdf-1.8-source.tar.gz`` from `MuPDF version 1.8 source <http://mupdf.com/downloads/>`_, and unzip / decompress it. Let us call the resulting folder ``mupdf18``.

Put it inside ``PyFitz`` as a subdirectory, if you want to keep everything in one place.

If your platform is **not Windows**, you must **generate MuPDF now**. The MuPDF download includes generation procedures / makefiles for numerous platforms.

On Windows, you have two options:
  * if you **have installed MS Visual Studio**, generate MuPDF ``lib`` files now. The respective VS project files are contained in ``./PyFitz/mupdf18/platform/win32``. If that worked fine, the ``lib`` files are now in ``./PyFitz/mupdf18/platform/win32/Release``. Update ``setup.py`` to reference this directory as ``library_dirs=['./mupdf18/platform/win32/Release']``.
  * if you have not installed Visual Studio or if you do not want to generate MuPDF, you must download `PyMuPDF Optional Material <https://github.com/JorjMcKie/PyMuPDF-optional-material/>`_ now and unzip / decompress its content in directory ``./PyFitz/PyMuPDF-optional-material``. This optional material contains the ``lib`` files needed for PyMuPDF generation.

Step 3: Build / Setup PyMuPDF
----------------------------------
If necessary, adjust the setup.py script now. E.g. make sure that

  * the include directory is correctly set in sync with your directory structure
  * the object code libraries are correctly defined

Now perform a ``python setup.py install``

Note on using UPX
------------------
In Windows systems, your PyMuPDF installation will end up with three files: ``__init__.py``, ``fitz.py`` and ``_fitz.pyd`` in the ``site-packages`` directory. The PYD file is Python's DLL version on Windows systems. ``_fitz.pyd`` has a size of 9.5 to 10 MB.

You can reduce this by applying the compression utility UPX to it: ``upx -9 _fitz.pyd``. This will reduce the file to about 4.5 MB. This should reduce load times (``import fitz`` statement) while keeping it fully functional.
