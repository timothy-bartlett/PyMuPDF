Installation
=============
This describes how to install PyMuPDF.

Step 1: Download PyMuPDF
-------------------------------
Download this repository and unzip it. This will give you a folder, let us call it ``PyFitz``.

Step 2: Download MuPDF 1.7a
---------------------------------
Download `MuPDF version 1.7a source <http://mupdf.com/downloads/>`_, and unzip it. Let us call the resulting folder ``mupdf17``.

Put it inside ``PyFitz`` as a subdirectory, if you want to keep everything in one place.

Step 3: Build / Setup PyMuPDF
----------------------------------
If necessary, adjust the setup.py script now. E.g. make sure that

  * the include directory is correctly set in sync with your directory structure

It is no longer necessary to generate MuPDF object code if your platform is either Windows or Linux.
The required object libraries for these two platforms have been put into respective directories, and the setup script has been updated. These are the names of those directories:

	* LibLinux - for the Linux-generated MuPDF libraries
	* LibWin32 - for the Windows-generated MuPDF libraries

Now perform a ``python setup.py install``

Note on Using UPX on Windows
------------------------------
In Windows systems, your PyMuPDF installation will end up with three files: ``__init__.py``, ``fitz.py`` and ``_fitz.pyd`` in the ``site-packages`` directory. The PYD file is Python's DLL version on Windows systems. ``_fitz.pyd`` has a size of 9.5 to 10 MB. You can reduce this by applying the compression utility UPX to it: ``upx -9 _fitz.pyd``. This will reduce the file to about 4.5 MB. This should reduce load times (``import fitz`` statement) while keeping it fully functional.
