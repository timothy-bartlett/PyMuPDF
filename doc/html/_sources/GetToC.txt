.. _GetToC:

=====================
GetToC
=====================
Create a (simple or extended) table of contents (ToC) of a document.

This method is identical to class method :meth:`Document.getToC`.

.. method:: GetToC(doc, simple = True)

  :param `doc`: A document created by one of the ``fitz.Document`` constructors.

  :type `doc`: :ref:`Document`

  :param `simple`: An indicator to specify whether link information is required.

  :type `simple`: boolean

  :rtype: list

  :returns: A Python list of bookmark entries of the form ``[[level, title, page, link], [...], ...]``. Note that the title entries have already been decoded to unicode here. Page numbers are 1-based. If invoked for an encrypted, not yet authenticated document, a ``ValueError`` exception will be raised. The difference between the simple and the extended (``simple = False``) versions is the presence of the link information of the bookmark (each bookmark also is a link, but not vice versa). Links are dictionaries with the same content structure as explained in :ref:`GetLinks`.
