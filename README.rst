This the **new version 1.7 of python-fitz**, a Python binding for `MuPDF <http://mupdf.com/>`_ - "a lightweight PDF and XPS viewer".

MuPDF can access files in PDF, XPS, OpenXPS and EPUB (e-book) formats, and it is known for its top performance and high rendering quality.

With python-fitz you therefore can also access files with extensions ``*.pdf``, ``*.xps``, ``*.oxps`` or ``*.epub`` from your Python scripts.

Documentation is available online `here <https://github.com/rk700/python-fitz/blob/master/doc/>`_ . In the doc dicrectory you can also find documentation version in several other formats. You download a `PDF <https://github.com/rk700/python-fitz/blob/master/doc/Python-Fitz.pdf>`_ or a `Windows Help <https://github.com/rk700/python-fitz/blob/master/doc/Python-Fitz.chm>`_ version.

We invite you to join our efforts by contributing to the the wiki pages.
