Introduction
============

This is the **new version 1.7 of PyMuPDF (formerly python-fitz)**, a Python binding which supports `MuPDF 1.7a <http://mupdf.com/>`_ - "a lightweight PDF and XPS viewer".

MuPDF can access files in PDF, XPS, OpenXPS and EPUB (e-book) formats, and it is known for its top performance and high rendering quality.

With PyMuPDF you therefore can also access files with extensions ``*.pdf``, ``*.xps``, ``*.oxps`` or ``*.epub`` from your Python scripts.


Installation
============

Normally it should be as easy as running ``python setup.py install`` once MuPDF is in place.

Refer to this `document <http://pythonhosted.org/PyMuPDF/installation.html>`_ for details.
