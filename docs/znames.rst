Deprecated Names
================

This list maps deprecated names of methods and attributes to their new "snake_case" versions.

This is a major effort, that we only can muster in a step-wise fashion. We believe, we so far (v1.18.7) are done with :ref:`Annot`, :ref:`Document`, :ref:`Page` , :ref:`Shape` and :ref:`TextWriter`.

Names of classes (camel case) and package-wide constants (the majority is upper case) remain untouched.
Deprecated names will remain available through MuPDF version 1.19.0 and probably be **removed in v1.20.0**. 

Deprecated names will no longer be separately documented.

.. note:: The following list is automatically generated.

  * References to new names (right column) always refer to method names - even if the name actually is a property. Please lookup to disambiguate.
  * One or two items refer to yet undocumented methods - please simply ignore.
