Deprecated Names
================

This is a list of names for methods and attributes with references to their current notions.
This list is a result of the effort to replace "mixedCase" names by their "snake_case" alternative.

This is a major effort, that we only can muster in a step-wise fashion. We believe we so far (v1.18.7) are done with :ref:`Annot`, :ref:`Document`, :ref:`Page` and :ref:`TextWriter`.

Names of classes and package-wide constants remain untouched.
Old names remain available for some time, but will be removed in some future version. Apart from this section however, old names will no longer be mentioned in this documentation.
