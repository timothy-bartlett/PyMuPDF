**Class API**

.. class:: Story

   .. method:: __init__(self, html=None, user_css=None, em=12, archive=None)

      Create a **story**, optionally providing HTML and CSS source.
      The HTML is parsed, and held within the Story as a DOM (Document Object Model).

      This structure may be modified: content (text, images) may be added,
      copied, modified or removed by using methods of the :ref:`Xml` class.

      When finished, the **story** can be written to any device;
      in typical usage the device may be provided by a :ref:`DocumentWriter` to make new pages.

      Here are some general remarks:

      * The :ref:`Story` constructor parses and validates the provided HTML to create the DOM.
      * PyMuPDF provides a number of ways to manipulate the HTML source by
        providing access to the *nodes* of the underlying DOM.
        Documents can be completely built from ground up programmatically,
        or the existing DOM can be modified pretty arbitrarily.
        For details of this interface, please see the :ref:`Xml` class.
      * If no (or no more) changes to the DOM are required,
        the story is ready to be laid out and to be fed to a series of devices
        (typically devices provided by a :ref:`DocumentWriter` to produce new pages).
      * The next step is to place the story and write it out.
        This can either be done directly, by looping around calling `place()` and `draw()`,
        or alternatively,
        the looping can handled for you using the `write()` or `write_stabilised()` methods.
        Which method you choose is largely a matter of taste.
        
        * To work in the first of these styles, the following loop should be used:
        
            1. Obtain a suitable device to write to;
               typically by requesting a new,
               empty page from a :ref:`DocumentWriter`.
            2. Determine one or more rectangles on the page,
               that should receive **story** data.
               Note that not every page needs to have the same set of rectangles.
            3. Pass each rectangle to the **story** to place it,
               learning what part of that rectangle has been filled,
               and whether there is more story data that did not fit.
               This step can be repeated several times with adjusted rectangles
               until the caller is happy with the results. 
            4. Optionally, at this point,
               we can request details of where interesting items have been placed,
               by calling the `element_positions()` method.
               Items are deemed to be interesting if their integer ``heading`` attribute is a non-zero
               (corresponding to HTML tags :htmlTag:`h1` - :htmlTag:`h6`),
               if their ``id`` attribute is not `None` (corresponding to HTML tag :htmlTag:`id`),
               or if their ``href`` attribute is not `None` (responding to HTML tag :htmlTag:`href`).
               This can conveniently be used for automatic generation of a Table of Contents,
               an index of images or the like.
            5. Next, draw that rectangle out to the device with the `draw()` method.
            6. If the most recent call to `place()` indicated that all the story data had fitted,
               stop now.
            7. Otherwise, we can loop back.
               If there are more rectangles to be placed on the current device (page),
               we jump back to step 3 - if not, we jump back to step 1 to get a new device.
        * Alternatively, in the case where you are using a :ref:`DocumentWriter`,
          the `write()` or `write_stabilized()` methods can be used.
          These handle all the looping for you,
          in exchange for being provided with callbacks that control the behaviour
          (notably a callback that enumerates the rectangles/pages to use).
      * Which part of the **story** will land on which rectangle / which page,
        is fully under control of the :ref:`Story` object and cannot be predicted.
      * Images may be part of a **story**. They will be placed together with any surrounding text.
      * Multiple stories may - independently from each other - write to the same page.
        For example, one may have separate stories for page header,
        page footer, regular text, comment boxes, etc.

      :arg str html: HTML source code. If omitted, a basic minimum is generated (see below).
      :arg str user_css: CSS source code. If provided, must contain valid CSS specifications.
      :arg float em: the default text font size.
      :arg archive: an :ref:`Archive` from which to load resources for rendering. Currently supported resource types are images and text fonts. If omitted, the story will not try to look up any such data and may thus produce incomplete output.
      
         .. note:: Instead of an actual archive, valid arguments for **creating** an :ref:`Archive` can also be provided -- in which case an archive will temporarily be constructed. So, instead of ``story = fitz.Story(archive=fitz.Archive("myfolder"))``, one can also shorter write ``story = fitz.Story(archive="myfolder")``.

   .. method:: place(where)

      Calculate that part of the story's content, that will fit in the provided rectangle. The method maintains a pointer which part of the story's content has already been written and upon the next invocation resumes from that pointer's position.

      :arg rect_like where: layout the current part of the content to fit into this rectangle. This must be a sub-rectangle of the page's :ref:`MediaBox<Glossary_MediaBox>`.

      :rtype: tuple[bool, rect_like]
      :returns: a bool (int) `more` and a rectangle `filled`. If `more == 0`, all content of the story has been written, otherwise more is waiting to be written to subsequent rectangles / pages. Rectangle `filled` is the part of `where` that has actually been filled.

   .. method:: draw(dev, matrix=None)

      Write the content part prepared by :meth:`Story.place` to the page.

      :arg dev: the :ref:`Device` created by `dev = writer.begin_page(mediabox)`. The device knows how to call all MuPDF functions needed to write the content.
      :arg matrix_like matrix: a matrix for transforming content when writing to the page. An example may be writing rotated text. The default means no transformation (i.e. the :ref:`Identity` matrix).

   .. method:: element_positions(function, args=None)

      Let the Story provide positioning information about certain HTML elements once their place on the current page has been computed - i.e. invoke this method **directly after** :meth:`Story.place`.

      :arg function: a Python function taking a :ref:`ElementPostion` instance, which will be invoked by this method to process positioning information.
      :arg dict args: an optional dictionary with any **additional** information that should be added to the ElementPosition instance passed to ``function``. Like for example the current output page number. Every key in this dictionary must be a string that conforms to the rules for a valid Python identifier. The complete set of information is explained below.

   .. method:: reset()

      Rewind the story's document to the beginning for starting over its output.

   .. attribute:: body

      The :htmlTag:`body` part of the story's DOM. Even if `html=None` has been used at story creation, the following minimum HTML source will always be available::

        <html>
            <head></head>
            <body></body>
        </html>

      This attribute contains the :ref:`Xml` node of :htmlTag:`body`. All relevant content for PDF production is contained between "<body>" and "</body>".

   .. method:: write(writer, rectfn, positionfn=None, pagefn=None)

       Places and draws Story to a `DocumentWriter`. Avoids the need for
       calling code to implement a loop that calls `Story.place()` and
       `Story.draw()` etc, at the expense of having to provide at least the
       `rectfn()` callback.
       
       :arg writer: a `DocumentWriter` or None.
       :arg rectfn: a callable taking `(rect_num: int, filled: Rect)` and
           returning `(mediabox, rect, ctm)`:
               mediabox:
                   None or rect for new page.
               rect:
                   The next rect into which content should be placed.
               ctm:
                   None or a `Matrix`.
       :arg positionfn: None, or a callable taking `(position: ElementPosition)`:
               position:
                   An `ElementPosition` with an extra `.page_num` member.
               Typically called multiple times as we generate elements that
               are headings or have an id.
       :arg pagefn:
           None, or a callable taking `(page_num, mediabox, dev, after)`;
           called at start (`after=0`) and end (`after=1`) of each page.

   .. staticmethod:: write_stabilized(writer, contentfn, rectfn, user_css=None, em=12, positionfn=None, pagefn=None, archive=None, add_header_ids=True)
   
       Static method that does iterative layout of html content to a
       `DocumentWriter`.

       For example this allows one to add a table of contents section
       while ensuring that page numbers are patched up until stable.

       Repeatedly creates a new `Story` from `(contentfn(),
       user_css, em, archive)` and lays it out with internal call
       to `Story.write()`; uses a None writer and extracts the list
       of `ElementPosition`'s which is passed to the next call of
       `contentfn()`.

       When the html from `contentfn()` becomes unchanged, we do a
       final iteration using `writer`.

       :arg writer:
           A `DocumentWriter`.
       :arg contentfn:
           A function taking a list of `ElementPositions` and
           returning a string containing html. The returned html
           can depend on the list of positions, for example with a
           table of contents near the start.
       :arg rectfn:
           A callable taking `(rect_num: int, filled: Rect)` and
           returning `(mediabox, rect, ctm)`:
               mediabox:
                   None or rect for new page.
               rect:
                   The next rect into which content should be
                   placed.
               ctm:
                   A `Matrix`.
       :arg pagefn:
           None, or a callable taking `(page_num, medibox,
           dev, after)`; called at start (`after=0`) and end
           (`after=1`) of each page.
       :arg archive:
           .
       :arg add_header_ids:
           If true, we add unique ids to all header tags that
           don't already have an id. This can help automatic
           generation of tables of contents.
       Returns:
           None.
       
   .. method:: write_with_links(rectfn, positionfn=None, pagefn=None)

       Similar to `write()` except that we don't have a `writer` arg
       and we return a PDF `Document` in which links have been created
       for each internal html link.

   .. staticmethod:: write_stabilized_with_links(contentfn, rectfn, user_css=None, em=12, positionfn=None, pagefn=None, archive=None, add_header_ids=True)

       Similar to `write_stabilized()` except that we don't have a `writer`
       arg and instead return a PDF `Document` in which links have been
       created for each internal html link.
    

Element Positioning CallBack function
--------------------------------------

The callback function can be used to log information about story output. The function's access to the information is read-only: it has no way to influence the story's output.

A typical loop for executing a story with using this method would look like this::

    HTML = """
    <html>
        <head></head>
        <body>
            <h1>Header level 1</h1>
            <h2>Header level 2</h2>
            <p>Hello MuPDF!</p>
        </body>
    </html>
    """
    MEDIABOX = fitz.paper_rect("letter")  # size of a page
    WHERE = MEDIABOX + (36, 36, -36, -36)  # leave borders of 0.5 inches
    story =  fitz.Story(html=HTML)  # make the story
    writer = fitz.DocumentWriter("test.pdf")  # make the writer
    pno = 0 # current page number
    more = 1  # will be set to 0 when done
    while more:  # loop until all story content is processed
        dev = writer.begin_page(MEDIABOX)  # make a device to write on the page
        more, filled = story.place(WHERE)  # compute content positions on page
        story.element_positions(recorder, {"page": pno})  # provide page number in addition
        story.draw(dev)
        writer.end_page()
        pno += 1  # increase page number
    writer.close()  # close output file

    def recorder(elpos):
        pass

Attributes of the ElementPosition class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The parameter passed to the ``recorder`` function is an object with the following attributes:

* ``elpos.depth`` (int) -- depth of this element in the box structure.

* ``elpos.heading`` (int) -- the header level, 0 if no header, 1-6 for :htmlTag:`h1` - :htmlTag:`h6`.

* ``elpos.href`` (str) -- value of the ``href`attribute, or None if not defined.

* ``elpos.id`` (str) -- value of the ``id`` attribute, or None if not defined.

* ``elpos.rect`` (tuple) -- element position on page.

* ``elpos.text`` (str) -- immediate text of the element.

* ``elpos.open_close`` (int bit field) -- bit 0 set: opens element, bit 1 set: closes element. Relevant for elements that may contain other elements and thus may not immediately be closed after being created / opened.

* ``elpos.rect_num`` (int) -- count of rectangles filled by the story so far.

* ``elpos.page_num`` (int) -- page number; only present when using `fitz.Story.write*()` functions.
