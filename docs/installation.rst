Installation
=============

PyMuPDF can be installed from Python wheels for Windows (32bit and 64bit), Linux (64bit, Intel and ARM) and Mac OSX (64bit, Intel), Python versions 3.6 and up::

  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  python -m pip install --upgrade pymupdf

There are no **mandatory** external dependencies. However, a few optional methods are available only if additional packages are installed:

* `Pillow <https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/>`_ is required for :meth:`Pixmap.pil_save` and :meth:`Pixmap.pil_tobytes`.
* `fontTools <https://pypi.org/project/fonttools/>`_ is required for :meth:`Document.subset_fonts`.
* `pymupdf-fonts <https://pypi.org/project/pymupdf-fonts/>`_ is a collection of nice fonts to be used for text output methods.


PyMuPDF does not support Python versions prior to 3.6. Some older wheels can be found `here <https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF-Optional-Material/tree/master/wheels-upto-Py3.5>`_.

To **install from sources**, follow these steps:


Step 1: Install MuPDF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For open source GNU AGPL licenses download from `here <https://mupdf.com/downloads/archive>`_.

If you are a commercial customer, please contact `Artifex <https://artifex.com/contact/>`_.

Install following the instructions for your platform.


Step 2: Download and Generate PyMuPDF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Download the sources from https://pypi.org/project/PyMuPDF/#files and decompress them.

Adjust the setup.py script when necessary. Especially make sure that ``include_dirs`` and ``library_dirs`` point to the folders of your MuPDF installation.

Now perform a *python setup.py install*.

.. note:: You can also install from sources of the Github repository. These **do not contain** the pre-generated files ``fitz.py`` or ``fitz_wrap.c``, which instead are generated by the installation script ``setup.py``. To use it, `SWIG <https://www.swig.org/>`_ must be installed on your system.
