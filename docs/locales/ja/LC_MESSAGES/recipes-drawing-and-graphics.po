"PDF files support elementary drawing operations as part of their syntax. "
"This includes basic geometrical objects like lines, curves, circles, "
"rectangles including specifying colors."

"The syntax for such operations is defined in \"A Operator Summary\" on "
"page 643 of the :ref:`AdobeManual`. Specifying these operators for a PDF "
"page happens in its :data:`contents` objects."

"PyMuPDF implements a large part of the available features via its "
":ref:`Shape` class, which is comparable to notions like \"canvas\" in "
"other packages (e.g. `reportlab <https://pypi.org/project/reportlab/>`_)."

"A shape is always created as a **child of a page**, usually with an "
"instruction like *shape = page.new_shape()*. The class defines numerous "
"methods that perform drawing operations on the page's area. For example, "
"*last_point = shape.draw_rect(rect)* draws a rectangle along the borders "
"of a suitably defined *rect = fitz.Rect(...)*."

msgid ""
"The returned *last_point* **always** is the :ref:`Point` where drawing "
"operation ended (\"last point\"). Every such elementary drawing requires "
"a subsequent :meth:`Shape.finish` to \"close\" it, but there may be "
"multiple drawings which have one common *finish()* method."

"In fact, :meth:`Shape.finish` *defines* a group of preceding draw "
"operations to form one -- potentially rather complex -- graphics object. "
"PyMuPDF provides several predefined graphics in `shapes_and_symbols.py "
"<https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF-"
"Utilities/blob/master/shapes/shapes_and_symbols.py>`_ which demonstrate "
"how this works."

"The drawing commands issued by a page can be extracted. Interestingly, "
"this is possible for :ref:`all supported document "

"Page method, :meth:`Page.get_drawings()` accesses draw commands and "
"converts them into a list of Python dictionaries. Each dictionary -- "
"called a \"path\" -- represents a separate drawing -- it may be simple "
"like a single line, or a complex combination of lines and curves "
"representing one of the shapes of the previous section."

"The *path* dictionary has been designed such that it can easily be used "
"by the :ref:`Shape` class and its methods. Here is an example for a page "

"As can be seen, there is a high congruence level with the :ref:`Shape` "
